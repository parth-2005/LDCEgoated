Rules:
- Write exactly 2–3 sentences. No more.
- Be specific: include names, amounts (with ₹ symbol and Indian number formatting), dates, and source databases.
- Reference data sources: U-DISE, Death Registry, Aadhaar records, payment ledger.
- Use formal but clear language a government officer would use.
- Do NOT use bullet points. Write as connected sentences.
- End with the single most important implication (e.g., "Payment must be recovered", "Identity verification required").
